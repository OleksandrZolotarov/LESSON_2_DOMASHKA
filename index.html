      <h2>Actor</h2>
      <p>Schwarzenegger, who worked under the pseudonym Arnold Strong in his first feature, HERCULES in New York,
         quickly made a name for himself in Hollywood. In 1977, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association recognized him
         with a Golden Globe® for New Male Star of the Year for his role in STAY HUNGRY opposite Sally Field. His big
         break came in 1982 when the sword and sorcery epic, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, hit box office gold. In 1984,
         Schwarzenegger blew up the screen and catapulted himself into cinema history as the title character in James
         Cameron’s sci-fi thriller, TERMINATOR. He is the only actor to be in both categories of the American Film
         Institute’s Hundred Years of Heroes and Villains for roles he played in the film. To date his films have
         grossed over $3 billion worldwide.</p>

      <h3 id="section">Governor</h3>
      <p>As governor, he was California's most effective marketing tool, traveling across the country and around the
         world promoting California-grown products, cutting-edge technologies and the state's diverse travel
         destinations. In addition, using his background as an internationally recognized athlete, Schwarzenegger made
         restoring health and fitness a top priority. He signed legislation making the state's school nutrition
         standards the most progressive in the nation and continues to promote healthy habits by taking harmful trans
         fats out of California restaurants and ensuring nutritional information is available to diners. To improve
         classrooms across the state and ensure that all California’s students have access to the world-class education
         they need to grow, thrive and succeed, Schwarzenegger led the reform to make California competitive for up to
         $700 million in federal Race to the Top funds.</p>
